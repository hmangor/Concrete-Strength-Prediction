# Concrete-Strength-Prediction

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete, a critical property in construction, using a polynomial regression model. The dataset used in this project contains various features that influence the compressive strength of concrete, including the amounts of different materials and the age of the concrete.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains the following features:

Cement (kg in a cubic meter)
Blast Furnace Slag (kg in a cubic meter)
Fly Ash (kg in a cubic meter)
Water (kg in a cubic meter)
Superplasticizer (kg in a cubic meter)
Coarse Aggregate (kg in a cubic meter)
Fine Aggregate (kg in a cubic meter)
Age (days)
The target variable is:
